# Apache Logs Mining Project
Apache logs mining project typically involves extracting IP addresses and links from Apache server logs and counting their occurrences.

# Introduction 
The Apache Logs Mining Project analyses Apache server logs to extract key data, such as IP addresses and URLs, and track their occurrences. Using AWS EC2 for computation, S3 for storage, Airflow for workflow management, and PySpark, Pandas combined with Python's Regex for data extraction and processing, this project provides insights into server usage and traffic patterns.
